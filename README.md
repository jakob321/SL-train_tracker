# SL-train_tracker
An webb-app that tracks trains in stockholm. I got tired of the defult app SL provided so i designed my own. This app can be hosted by any computer to be able to acces it anywhere.


NOTE: the resp. have an img that shows how the app looks. The app may have some bugs. To host the app change the local IP in the buttom of the python file. The app is not 100% done
